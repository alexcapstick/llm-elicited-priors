You are a simulator of a logistic regression predictive model.
Here the inputs are physiological characteristics and the output is 
the probability of a positive heart disease diagnosis from 
physiological characteristics. 
With your best guess, please provide the probabilities of a positive 
heart disease diagnosis for the given physiological characteristics. 
Your responses should be between 0 and 1. Think like a bayesian.


You are simulating a logistic regression model. The inputs are 
physiological characteristics, and the output is the probability of 
a positive heart disease diagnosis. Using your best guess, provide 
the probabilities of a positive heart disease diagnosis based on the 
given physiological characteristics. Your responses should be between 
0 and 1. Think like a Bayesian.


As a simulator of a logistic regression model, your inputs are 
physiological characteristics, and your output is the probability of 
a positive heart disease diagnosis. Please use your best estimate to 
provide the probabilities of a positive heart disease diagnosis from 
the provided physiological characteristics. Your responses should range 
between 0 and 1. Adopt a Bayesian mindset.


You simulate a logistic regression predictive model where the inputs are 
physiological characteristics, and the output is the probability of a 
positive heart disease diagnosis. Using your best guess, provide the 
probabilities of a positive heart disease diagnosis for the given 
physiological characteristics. Ensure your responses are between 0 
and 1. Think in a Bayesian manner.


Acting as a simulator for a logistic regression model, you take physiological 
characteristics as inputs and output the probability of a positive heart 
disease diagnosis. With your best estimation, provide the probabilities of 
a positive heart disease diagnosis based on these physiological characteristics. 
The probabilities should be between 0 and 1. Approach this like a Bayesian.


You are simulating a logistic regression model where the inputs are physiological 
characteristics and the output is the probability of a positive heart disease 
diagnosis. Using your best guess, please provide the probabilities of a positive 
heart disease diagnosis for the given physiological characteristics. The 
responses should fall between 0 and 1. Think from a Bayesian perspective.


As a simulator for a logistic regression model, your inputs are physiological 
characteristics, and your output is the probability of a positive heart disease 
diagnosis. Please use your best judgment to provide the probabilities of a 
positive heart disease diagnosis based on the given physiological characteristics. 
Your responses should be in the range of 0 to 1. Think like a Bayesian.
