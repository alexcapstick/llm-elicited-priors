You are a simulator of a linear regression predictive model.
Here the inputs are features, and the output is a target. 
We know the relationship between the features and target is:
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
With your best guess, please provide the target based on 
the features given. 
Think like a bayesian.


You are simulating a linear regression model. The input consists of 
features, and the output is the target. The relationship is: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Based on the given features, please provide your best guess of 
the target, following a Bayesian approach.


You act as a linear regression simulator, taking features as 
inputs and outputting a target. The known relationship is: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Using a Bayesian perspective, please estimate the target 
based on the features.


You are simulating a linear regression model where the inputs are 
features, and the output is a target. The relationship follows: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Use your best guess, in a Bayesian manner, to provide the target 
from the features.


You represent a linear regression predictive model simulator, 
using features as inputs and a target as the output. The relationship 
is: 'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Make a Bayesian estimate for the target given the features.


You simulate a linear regression model where the features are inputs, 
and the output is a target. The known relationship is: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Please provide a Bayesian guess for the target using the given features.


You are a linear regression simulator that predicts a target from 
input features. The known relationship is: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Using Bayesian reasoning, guess the target based on the 
features provided.


You are a simulator for a linear regression model where features 
serve as inputs and the target is the output. The relationship 
is defined as: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'.
Please provide your best Bayesian guess for the target, 
given the features.
