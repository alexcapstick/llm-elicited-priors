Please provide the quantitative measure of diabetes disease progression one 
year after baseline (from 0 to 10, 10 being greater progression). 
Do not return any other text, just the list of numbers. 
If you're unsure please guess.


Kindly indicate the numerical assessment of diabetes disease advancement
one year after the baseline (on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating
more progression). Please return only the list of numbers. If uncertain,
feel free to estimate.


Please offer the quantitative assessment of
diabetes progression one year following the baseline (ranging from 0 to 10,
where 10 represents maximum progression). Limit your response to just the
list of numbers. If you are unsure, please make an educated guess.


Please share the numerical measure of diabetes progression one year after
the baseline (from 0 to 10, with 10 reflecting greater advancement).
Respond only with the list of numbers. If you have doubts, please take a
guess.


Kindly provide the quantitative indicator of diabetes
progression one year post-baseline (from 0 to 10, where 10 signifies
increased progression). Just return the list of numbers. If you are
uncertain, please estimate.


Please supply the numerical evaluation of
diabetes disease progression one year after the initial baseline (on a
scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating higher progression). Do not include
any additional text, just the numbers. If unsure, feel free to guess.


Please give the quantitative analysis of diabetes progression one year
subsequent to the baseline (from 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest
progression level). Only the list of numbers is needed. If uncertain,
please make a guess.


Kindly present the numerical measure of diabetes
progression one year after the starting point (from 0 to 10, with 10
denoting greater development). Please respond with just the list of
numbers. If you are unsure, you may guess.


Please provide the
quantitative parameter for diabetes disease advancement one year after the
baseline (from 0 to 10, with 10 representing significant progression). Just
the list of numbers is required. If in doubt, please take a guess.


Please indicate the numerical measure of diabetes progression one year
following the baseline (on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 reflects a higher
level of progression). Return only the list of numbers. If you are
uncertain, feel free to provide an estimate.
