Please provide the target using:
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Do not 
return any other text, just the list of numbers. 
If you're unsure please guess.

Calculate the target using: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Provide only the list of numbers. If uncertain, 
make your best guess.


Use the formula: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2' 
to determine the target. Return only the numbers in the list. 
If you're unsure, please estimate.


Please compute the target as: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Respond with just the list of numbers. 
If needed, make an educated guess.


Derive the target using the formula: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Provide only the list of numbers. 
Guess if necessary.


Using the relationship: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2', 
output only the list of numbers. If you're unsure, 
provide your best guess.


Compute the target with: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Return only the list of numbers. If unsure, make a guess.


Please use this equation to compute the target: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Provide only the list of numbers, 
and if uncertain, give your best estimate.


Find the target using: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Provide the list of numbers only. 
If you're unsure, estimate.


Calculate the target from: 
'target' = 2 * 'feature 0' - 1 * 'feature 1' + 1 * 'feature 2'. 
Return only the numbers. If in doubt, guess.
