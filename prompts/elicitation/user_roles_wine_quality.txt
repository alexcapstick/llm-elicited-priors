I am a data scientist with a dataset and the task: predicting wine 
quality from its physicochemical characteristics. 
I would like to use your model to predict the quality of my samples.
I have a dataset that is made up of the following features:
{feature_names}.
All of the feature values are standardized using the z-score.
By thinking about how each feature might be related to the quality of 
{unique_targets}, 
and whether each feature is positively or negatively correlated with the 
outcome of
{target_map},
I would like you to guess the 
mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior for each feature
for a logistic regression model can be used for
predicting wine quality from its physicochemical characteristics.
Please respond with a JSON object with the feature names as keys 
and a nested dictionary of mean and standard deviation as values.
A positive mean indicates a positive correlation with the outcome,
a negative mean indicates a negative correlation with the outcome,
whilst a small standard deviation indicates that you are confident in your guess.
Please only respond with a JSON, no other text.


As a data scientist, I have a dataset and the task of predicting wine 
quality based on its physicochemical characteristics. I seek to use your 
model to predict the quality of my samples. My dataset includes these 
features: {feature_names}. Each feature value is standardized using the 
z-score. By considering how each feature might relate to the quality of 
{unique_targets} and whether each feature is positively or negatively 
correlated with the outcome of {target_map}, I would like you to estimate 
the mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior for each 
feature for a logistic regression model. This model will be used to predict 
wine quality from its physicochemical characteristics. Please provide a JSON 
object with the feature names as keys and a nested dictionary of mean and 
standard deviation as values. A positive mean indicates a positive correlation 
with the outcome, a negative mean indicates a negative correlation with the

I am a data scientist tasked with predicting wine quality from its physicochemical 
characteristics. I would like to use your model to predict the quality of my samples.
My dataset contains the following features: {feature_names}, all standardized 
using the z-score. By analyzing how each feature might be associated with the 
quality of {unique_targets} and whether each feature is positively or negatively 
correlated with the outcome of {target_map}, I would like you to guess the mean 
and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior for each feature. This will 
be for a logistic regression model predicting wine quality from its physicochemical 
characteristics. Please reply with a JSON object where feature names are keys and 
a nested dictionary of mean and standard deviation are values. A positive mean 
suggests a positive correlation with the outcome, a negative mean suggests a 
negative correlation, and a small standard deviation suggests high confidence.

As a data scientist working on predicting wine quality from physicochemical 
characteristics, I need to use your model to evaluate my samples. My dataset 
consists of the following features: {feature_names}, all standardized via the 
z-score method. By thinking about the relationship of each feature to the 
quality of {unique_targets} and the positive or negative correlation with the 
outcome of {target_map}, I need you to estimate the mean and standard deviation 
for a normal distribution prior for each feature. This is for a logistic 
regression model that predicts wine quality from its physicochemical characteristics. 
Please provide a JSON object where the feature names are keys and each key has 
a nested dictionary with mean and standard deviation as values. A positive mean 
shows a positive correlation, a negative mean shows a negative correlation, and 
a small standard deviation shows confidence. Please respond with a JSON only, 
no other text.
