I am a data scientist with a dataset and the task: predicting median 
house prices in California in 1990 from census data. 
I would like to use your model to predict the median house value of my samples.
I have a dataset that is made up of the following features:
{feature_names}.
All of the feature values are standardized using the z-score.
By thinking about how each feature might be related to {unique_targets}, 
and whether each feature is positively or negatively correlated with the 
outcome of
{unique_targets},
I would like you to guess the 
mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior for each feature
for a linear regression model can be used for
predicting median house prices in California in 1990 from census data.
Please respond with a JSON object with the feature names as keys 
and a nested dictionary of mean and standard deviation as values.
A positive mean indicates a positive correlation with the outcome,
a negative mean indicates a negative correlation with the outcome,
whilst a small standard deviation indicates that you are confident in your guess.
Please only respond with a JSON, no other text.
