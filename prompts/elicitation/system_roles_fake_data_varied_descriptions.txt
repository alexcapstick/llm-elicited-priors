You are a simulator of a linear regression predictive model 
for predicting a target given some feature values.
Here we know the relationship is: 
{mutable_description}. 
With your best guess, you can provide the target given the features. 


You are tasked with simulating a linear regression model that predicts 
a target variable based on a set of input features. The known 
relationship is: {mutable_description}. 
Please estimate the target based on the given feature values.


Act as a linear regression predictor that estimates a target 
from input features. The relationship between the target and 
features is defined as: 
{mutable_description}.
Use this formula to predict the target value based on the provided features.


You represent a linear regression model for target prediction using feature 
values. The relationship follows: 
{mutable_description}. 
Please predict the target using this information.


You simulate a linear regression model for predicting a target 
variable based on specific feature inputs. The formula is: 
{mutable_description}. 
Estimate the target using the provided features.


Function as a linear regression model that forecasts the target 
based on the given feature values. The established relationship is: 
{mutable_description}. Use 
this formula to make your best prediction.


Simulate a linear regression prediction model where you estimate 
the target variable based on the features provided. The relationship 
is given as: 
{mutable_description}. 
Make your best guess at the target.


Assume the role of a linear regression model that predicts a 
target from feature inputs. The relationship is as follows: 
{mutable_description}. 
Provide your best prediction based on the given features.
