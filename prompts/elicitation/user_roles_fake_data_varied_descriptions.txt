I am a data scientist with a dataset and the task: 
predicting a target given some feature values.
I would like to use your model to predict the target value of my samples.
I have a dataset that is made up of the following features:
{feature_names}.
All of the feature values are standardized using the z-score.
Here we know the relationship is: 
{mutable_description}
By thinking about how each feature is be related to {unique_targets}, 
and whether each feature is positively or negatively correlated with the 
outcome of
{unique_targets},
I would like you to guess the 
mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior for each feature
for a linear regression model can be used for
predicting the target from the feature values.
Please respond with a JSON object with the feature names as keys 
and a nested dictionary of mean and standard deviation as values.
A positive mean indicates a positive correlation with the outcome,
a negative mean indicates a negative correlation with the outcome,
whilst a small standard deviation indicates that you are confident in your guess.
Please only respond with a JSON, no other text.


I’m a data scientist working on a dataset with the task of 
predicting a target using feature values. I want to apply your 
model to estimate the target for my samples. My dataset includes 
the following features: {feature_names}. All feature values are 
standardized using z-scores. The relationship we know is: 
{mutable_description}. 
Based on how each feature correlates with {unique_targets}, either 
positively or negatively, please estimate the mean and standard 
deviation for a normal distribution prior for each feature. This 
will allow us to create a linear regression model to predict the 
target from the features. Provide the output as a JSON object where 
the feature names are the keys, and each key has a nested dictionary 
of mean and standard deviation as values. A positive mean suggests 
a positive correlation with the outcome, and a negative mean implies 
a negative correlation, while a small standard deviation reflects 
confidence in your estimate. Only respond with JSON, please.


I am a data scientist working with a dataset for a prediction task using 
feature values to predict a target. I would like to apply your model to 
predict the target for my samples. My dataset consists of these 
features: {feature_names}. All the values have been standardized 
using z-scores. The known relationship is: 
{mutable_description}. 
Based on the correlation between each feature and {unique_targets}, 
whether positive or negative, please guess the mean and standard 
deviation for a normal distribution prior for each feature. I need 
this for creating a linear regression model to predict the target. 
Provide your response as a JSON object with the feature names as keys, 
each containing a nested dictionary for the mean and standard deviation. 
A positive mean suggests positive correlation with the outcome, negative 
for negative correlation, and a smaller standard deviation indicates 
higher confidence. Only respond with JSON.


As a data scientist, I’m working on a prediction task where I need to 
predict a target using feature values. I would like to use your model 
to predict the target for my samples. The dataset contains these features: 
{feature_names}, all standardized by the z-score. The known relationship is: 
{mutable_description}. Please guess 
the mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior for each 
feature, considering their positive or negative correlation with {unique_targets}. 
I want to use this information to build a linear regression model for target 
prediction. Respond with a JSON object where the feature names are the keys, 
and the nested values are dictionaries with mean and standard deviation. 
A positive mean shows a positive correlation, negative shows negative 
correlation, and a small standard deviation indicates confidence in your 
guess. Please provide only a JSON object.

As a data scientist, I have a dataset where my task is to predict a target 
using feature values. I would like to use your model to predict the target 
values for my samples. The dataset is comprised of {feature_names}, all 
standardized via z-scores. We know the relationship: 
{mutable_description}.
