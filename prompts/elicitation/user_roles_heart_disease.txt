I am a data scientist with a dataset and the task: predicting heart 
disease diagnosis from physiological characteristics. 
I would like to use your model to predict the diagnosis of my samples.
I have a dataset that is made up of the following features:
{feature_names}.
All of the feature values are standardized using the z-score, except those with
the values given in their description.
By thinking about how each feature might be related to a diagnosis of 
{unique_targets}, 
and whether each feature is positively or negatively correlated with the 
outcome of
{target_map},
I would like you to guess the 
mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior for each feature
for a logistic regression model can be used for
predicting heart disease diagnosis from physiological characteristics.
Please respond with a JSON object with the feature names as keys 
and a nested dictionary of mean and standard deviation as values.
A positive mean indicates a positive correlation with the outcome,
a negative mean indicates a negative correlation with the outcome,
whilst a small standard deviation indicates that you are confident in your guess.
Please only respond with a JSON, no other text. 


I am a data scientist working with a dataset to predict heart disease 
diagnosis based on physiological characteristics. I want to use your 
model to predict the diagnoses for my samples. My dataset includes the 
following features: {feature_names}. All feature values are standardized 
using the z-score, except where otherwise noted. Considering how each 
feature might relate to a diagnosis of {unique_targets}, and whether each 
feature is positively or negatively correlated with the outcome of {target_map}, 
please guess the mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior 
for each feature in a logistic regression model used for predicting heart 
disease diagnosis. Please respond with a JSON object where feature names are 
keys, and each key maps to a nested dictionary containing the mean and standard 
deviation. A positive mean indicates a positive correlation with the outcome, 
a negative mean indicates a negative correlation, and a small standard deviation 
indicates confidence in your guess. Only respond with the JSON, no other text.


As a data scientist, I have a dataset and a task: predicting heart disease 
diagnosis from physiological characteristics. I seek to use your model for 
predicting the diagnosis of my samples. The dataset comprises the following 
features: {feature_names}, with all values standardized using the z-score, 
except for those specified. By evaluating the relationship of each feature 
to a diagnosis of {unique_targets} and their correlation (positive or negative) 
with {target_map}, please estimate the mean and standard deviation for a 
normal distribution prior for each feature in a logistic regression model. 
Please provide a JSON object with feature names as keys and nested dictionaries 
of mean and standard deviation as values. Positive means indicate positive 
correlation with the outcome, negative means indicate negative correlation, 
and small standard deviations indicate high confidence. Respond only 
with JSON, no other text. 


I am a data scientist tasked with predicting heart disease diagnosis using 
physiological characteristics in my dataset. I want to leverage your model 
for my sample predictions. The dataset includes the following features: 
{feature_names}, standardized using the z-score unless otherwise noted. Based 
on how each feature may relate to a diagnosis of {unique_targets} and their

Your response should be a JSON object with feature names as keys and nested 
dictionaries of mean and standard deviation as values. Positive means denote 
positive correlation, negative means denote negative correlation, and small 
standard deviations denote high confidence. Only reply with JSON, no other text.
