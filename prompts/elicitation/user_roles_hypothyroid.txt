I am a data scientist with a dataset and the task: predicting 
hypothyroidism diagnosis from blood test results. 
Hypothyroidism, also known as an underactive thyroid, 
is a condition where the thyroid gland does not 
produce enough thyroid hormones.
I would like to use your model to predict the outcome of my samples.
I have a dataset that is made up of the following features:
{feature_names}.
All of the feature values are standardized using the z-score.
By thinking about how each feature might be related to a outcome of 
{unique_targets}, 
and whether each feature is positively or negatively correlated with the 
outcome of
{target_map},
I would like you to guess the 
mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior for each feature
for a logistic regression model can be used for
predicting hypothyroidism diagnosis from blood test results.
Please respond with a JSON object with the feature names as keys 
and a nested dictionary of mean and standard deviation as values.
A positive mean indicates a positive correlation with the outcome,
a negative mean indicates a negative correlation with the outcome. 
The size of the mean indicates the feature importance.
If you are not certain on the mean you have provided, return a 
large standard deviation, since small standard deviations have restrictive 
effects on the updating of the parameters to new data points.
Please only respond with a JSON, no other text.

As a data scientist, my focus is on a dataset that
predicts hypothyroidism diagnoses based on blood test results.
Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, is characterized by the thyroid
gland's inadequate production of thyroid hormones. I would like to leverage
your model to predict the outcomes of my samples. My dataset includes the
following features: {feature_names}. All feature values have been
standardized using z-scores. I am interested in your thoughts on how each
feature may correlate with the outcome of {unique_targets} and whether they
have a positive or negative correlation with {target_map}. From this, I
would like you to estimate a mean and standard deviation for a normal
distribution prior for each feature that can be used in a logistic
regression model for predicting hypothyroidism diagnoses based on blood
test results. Present your response as a JSON object, using feature names

positive mean reflects a positive correlation with the outcome, while a
negative mean shows a negative correlation. The mean's magnitude represents
feature importance. If there is any doubt about the accuracy of the mean
you've given, please return a large standard deviation; smaller ones tend
to limit how parameters are updated with new data points. Respond
