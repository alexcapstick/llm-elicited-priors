I am a data scientist with a dataset and the task: predicting breast 
cancer diagnosis from tumour characteristics. 
I would like to use your model to predict the diagnosis of my samples.
I have a dataset that is made up of the following features:
{feature_names}.
All of the feature values are standardized using the z-score.
By thinking about how each feature might be related to a diagnosis of 
{unique_targets}, 
and whether each feature is positively or negatively correlated with the 
outcome of
{target_map},
I would like you to guess the 
mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior for each feature
for a logistic regression model can be used for
predicting breast cancer diagnosis from tumour characteristics.
Please respond with a JSON object with the feature names as keys 
and a nested dictionary of mean and standard deviation as values.
A positive mean indicates a positive correlation with the outcome,
a negative mean indicates a negative correlation with the outcome,
whilst a small standard deviation indicates that you are confident in your guess.
Please only respond with a JSON, no other text.


I am a data scientist working on predicting breast cancer diagnosis from 
tumour characteristics using a specific dataset. 
I seek to leverage your model for diagnosing my samples. The dataset comprises 
the following features: {feature_names}. All feature values are standardized 
with z-scores. By considering how each feature correlates with the diagnosis 
of {unique_targets} and the direction of correlation as indicated in {target_map}, 
please estimate the mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution prior 
for each feature suitable for a logistic regression model for predicting breast cancer diagnosis from tumour characteristics. Provide 
your response in JSON format with feature names as keys and a nested dictionary 
of mean and standard deviation as values. A positive mean signifies a positive 
correlation, a negative mean a negative correlation, and a small standard 
deviation indicates high confidence in your estimate. Only respond with the 
JSON object, without additional text.
